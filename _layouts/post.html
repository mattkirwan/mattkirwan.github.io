	<h3>Debate is good&#8230;comments are evil</h3>

	<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong I believe solid discussions and healthy debates are fantastic. However, and I make no apologies for this, I absolutely despise &#8216;blog&#8217; comment threads - good because they make debate easy, bad because they breed not only the worst traits of humans but are perfect fodder for the worst of the internet.</p>

	<h3>Got something to say?</h3>

	<p>Please do <a href="https://twitter.com/mattkirwan">drop me a tweet</a> lets get the discussion going on over there.</p>
