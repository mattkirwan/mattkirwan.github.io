It's a common occurrence in our industry to have heard of a technology, glean a vague idea of "what it is" but never have the opportunity to actually explore the technology any further.

This introductory article has been specifically designed for anyone with zero knowledge of Apache Kafka to get up-to-speed quickly with the fundamentals. So, whether preparing yourself for delving further into this technology or just trying to keep up with the Jones' in preparation for your next tech event.

You should finish reading this article feeling confident, somewhat more knowledgeable and hopefully inspired to explore Apache Kafka further.

# So What Is Apache Kafka?

It's a streaming/messaging platform.

# Ok, that's great. But, _what_ is it?

Think of Apache Kafka as a transaction log or publish/subscribe platform.

You produce messages onto a kafka topic and then you can subscribe to that topic and consume those same messages elsewhere.

It's distributed by design.
It's fault tolerant.
It's fast.
